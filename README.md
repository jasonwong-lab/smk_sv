## Usage

1. **Ensure you have clonned this repo and navigated into it.**

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/jasonwong-lab/smk_sv.git
   cd smk_sv
   ```

   - Follow all steps below after you are in the top dir of this repo.
   - Uncomment all rules in the `Snakefile`.
   - Check the predefined `wildcards_constraints` in the `Snakefile` and modify/delete it if necessary.
   - Using a JSON schema to validate the configuration file might prevent Snakemake from monitoring changes to the parameters. You can comment the `validate(config, "config/config.schema.json")` in the `Snakefile`.

2. **Install [AnnotSV](https://github.com/lgmgeo/AnnotSV) by yourself.**
   - AnnotSV is not included in the image due to its large annotation resources (~ 20GB) that cannot be specified elsewhere.
   - Creating a lock file for each combination of sample and type_sv has been implemented. However, AnnotSV might still encounter errors since it doesnâ€™t support processing multiple files within the same directory. To address this, an additional resource parameter `constraint_annotsv=1` has been added to the rule `annotate_sv_annotsv` to ensure that only one instance of AnnotSV runs at a time. You can modify this parameter in `workflow/profile/default/config.yaml` where its default is `1`.

3. **Create `config/config.yaml` from `config/config-test.yaml`.**

   - Specification of important elements:
      - `dir_run`: working directory where all results will be stored.
      - `mapper`: dict whose keys are names of mappers and values (boolean) indicate whether perform mapping or not. Only the first mapper will be used. When a mapper is specified and its value is `false`, no mapping by this mapper will be performed, but its results will be used in the following steps.
      - `callers`: dict whose keys are names of callers and values (boolean) indicate whether perform SV calling using this caller or not. When a caller is specified and its value is `false`, no SV calling by this caller will be performed, but its results will be used in the following steps.
      - `types_sv`: SV types to be called. BND indicates translocations.
      - `threads`: number of CPUs of each rule to be used.
      - ...
   - You must change the file paths specified in the config.

4. **Create `config/pep/samples.csv` and `config/pep/config.yaml` from `config/pep/samples-test.csv` and `config/pep/config-test.yaml`.**
   - Only `sample_name` in the table will be used.
   - More information please see [Portable Encapsulated Projects (PEP)](https://pep.databio.org).

5. **Create `workflow/profiles/default/config.yaml` from `workflow/profiles/default/config-test.yaml`.**
   - Bind directories you need in the container.
   - Change the number of CPUs you prefer.
   - Modify/add/delete other parameters of this snakemake pipeline.

6. **Create conda environments.**

   ```shell
   snakemake --conda-create-envs-only
   ```

7. **Run the whole pipeline.**

   ```shell
   snakemake
   ```
   If you want to run this pipeline on a cluster (e.g., SLURM, or PBS), you should customise your own profile and place it into `~/.config/snakemake/`, and then run the pipeline with the profile you have set as a parameter:
   ```shell
   snakemake --profile <your_profile_name>
   ```
   Or run the pipeline with the profile you have set as an environment variable:
   ```shell
   export SNAKEMAKE_PROFILE=<your_profile_name>
   snakemake
   ```
   You can refer to the profile I have been using at `workflow/profiles/mycluster`, or turn to snakemake websites.

## Note for Cluster Users

If you are using a cluster that does not support Singularity well, please switch to the `without_docker` branch of this repository. This branch is tailored for environments where containers might not be the best option.

```shell
git checkout without_docker
```
